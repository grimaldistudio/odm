# Entypo+

#### ~~388~~ 397 carefully crafted premium pictograms by [Daniel Bruce][author]

[Entypo+][project] is the third version of a free suite of premium quality
pictograms. Itâ€™s released under the license [CC BY-SA 4.0][license]. Each
pictogram has been drawn for pixel perfection at a size of 20 x 20 pixels and
with a very consistent style. The difference between this version of Entypo and
previous ones is that the suite now only consist of SVG images. There is no
fonts or PSD included with the official distribution.

#### ...hence this repository.

I simply repackaged the SVG icon sets with [IcoMoon][icomoon] and added
`bower.json` so I can use them in my projects.

## Usage

Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their
codes/ligatures.

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when
including the generated font in your own projects.


You can import *selection.json* back to the [IcoMoon][icomoon] app using the
*Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu > Manage Projects) to retrieve the icon
selection.
